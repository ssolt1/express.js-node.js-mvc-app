Section 3 notes:
Good point, this can be confusing at first.
We write the code for our routes in routes/*js,
but they don't work until they are .use in app.js.
This allows to group the definitions in some url's into seperate files.

test GET via browser http://localhost/contacts/1 or
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/contacts/1
Hello for contact 1

test POST via curl:
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/contacts/1
Post for contact 1

text PUT via curl:
$ curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/contacts/1
Put for contact 1

test DELETE via curl:
$ curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/contacts/1
Delete for contact 1
